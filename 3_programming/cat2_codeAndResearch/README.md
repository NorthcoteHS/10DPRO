# CAT 2: Code and Research

Our second CAT has two components:

1. A Python program, chosen from a list of available options.
2. A research assignment.

## Python program

For the first half of your CAT, your task is to complete **one** of the following Python programs:

- [Trivia Game](./triviaGame/)
- [Personality Quiz](./personalityQuiz/)
- [Study Buddy](./studyBuddy/)

See the relevant page for the program of your choice. Each program has different specific requirements, but will be assessed by the same general rubric.

## Research assignment

The second half of your CAT involves choosing a topic of your choice in Computing and researching it, in pairs or individually. More information on the [Research Component page](./researchComponent/).
